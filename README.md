# Roof

I first got the idea for Roof when I worked as an Estate Agent (Realtor for rentals in American) in London. It was clear that those who were able
to speak to the existing tenants before making an offer on a property had a concrete advantage compared to those who weren't able to speak to the
previous tenants. It struck me that there is no transparency in the lettings business, and no form of accountability. In everything else in the
economy, you can find a rating or review beforehand to ensure the seller/provider is trusted. But when it comes to the biggest expense that people
make in a year - renting - there was no clarity whatsoever. Landlords are often unresponsive or neglectful, because there are no consequences for
poor behaviour.
